## Outcomes in epidemiologic research

Epidemiologic studies address the occurrence of diseases and other health related phenomena:

- (a) cross-sectional: **prevalence** of diseases, 
- (b) longitudinal: disease **incidence**, and mortality

Often we want to compare the prevalence or incidence of disease between two groups defined by a binary *risk factor X*

- *X* = 1: `exposed` *X* = 0: `unexposed`

## Types of outcome variables

- *Binary* (0/1) variables at individual level
  + disease *status* at a *time point* 
  +  *change* of status, *event* or *transition* 
     ({\it e.g.} from healthy to diseased) 
  
- *Proportions* at group level
  + prevalence 
  + incidence proportion or cumulative incidence,
- *Rates* of events
  + incidence or mortality rate (per 1000 y)
  +  car accidents (per million km)

- *Time* to event
  + survival time (often censored)

## Incidence and prevalence proportions}

- **Incidence proportion** ($R$) of a binary (0/1) outcome (disease,
death etc.) over a fixed risk period is defined 
$$
 R = {D\over N} 
  = \frac{ \mbox{number of new cases during period} }
         { \mbox{size of population-at-risk at start} }  
$$
Also called {\bf cumulative incidence} (or even ``risk'').\\
 \medskip
**NB**. This formula requires complete follow-up, i.e.
no {\it censorings}, and absence of {\it competing risks}.
\bigskip
-  **Prevalence (proportion)** $P$ of disease
at time point $t$ 
$$ P 
    = {\mbox{no. of existing cases at } t \over 
   \mbox{total population size at } t } . 
$$


## Two-group comparison

- Binary risk factor $X$: exposed vs. unexposed.
- Summarizy results from cohort study with fixed risk period and no losses:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc} \hline
Exposure         &        Cases        &    Non-cases    &    Group size\\ \hline
      yes        &            $D_{1}$ &        $C_{1}$  &    $N_{1}$  \\
      no         &            $D_{0}$  &        $C_{0}$  &    $N_{0}$\\ \hline
    total        &           $D_{\+}$  &        $C_{\+}$  &   $N_{\+}$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

- Incidence proportions in the two exposure groups
$$ R_1 = \frac{D_1}{N_1}, \qquad
   R_0 = \frac{D_0}{N_0} . $$ 
- These are crude *estimates* of the true *risks* $\pi_{1}$, and $\pi_{0}$ of outcome in the two exposure categories.


## Example: Observational clinical study

Treatment failure in two types of operation for renal calculi 
(Charig \textit{et al.} 1986. \textit{BMJ} 292: 879-882)

- OS = open surgery (invasive)
- PN = percutaneous nephrolithotomy 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc} \hline
Treatment & Failure  &  Success   &   Patients  & Failure-\% \\
group ($j$) &  ($D_{j}$) &  ($C_{j}$) &  ($N_{j}$) &  ($R_{j}$)\\ \hline
   OS ($j=1$)    & 77     & 273   & 350        & {\em 22.0}   \\
   PN ($j=0$)    & 60     & 290   & 350        & {\em 17.1} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Crude incidence proportions of treatment failure: $$R_1 = 77/350 = 22.0\%,\qquad R_0 = 60/350 = 17.1\%$$ 

## Risks and their comparative parameters

The **risk** or **probability** of binary outcome (*e.g.* new case of disease) in the `exposed` $\pi_1$ and in the `unexposed` $\pi_0$ as to binary risk factor $X$ (values 1 and 0) are typically compared by

- risk difference $\quad \theta = \pi_1 - \pi_0$
- risk ratio $\quad	\quad \quad \phi = \pi_1/\pi_0$
- odds ratio (risk odds ratio)
$$\psi = \frac{\pi_1/(1 - \pi_1)}{\pi_0/(1 - \pi_0)}$$

The odds ratio is close to the risk ratio when the risks are `small` (less than $0.1$\ -- the `rare-disease assumption`).

## Odds and Odds Ratio (OR)

The **odds ($\Omega$)** is the probability of binary outcome $P(Y=1)=\pi$ divided by the the probability of binary outcome $P(Y=0)=1-\pi$. 

$$\Omega=\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$$

- Odds of 2.5 means that the probability of Y=1 (success) is two
and half times higher than the probability of Y=0 (failure)
- Odds 0.5 means that success probability of success is 50% of
the probability of failure
- Odds of 1 implies that probability of both
outcomes 0.5 (equal)

## Risks and comparative parameters estimated

The risks $\pi_1$ and $\pi_0$ are estimated by empirical incidence proportions $R_1=D_1/N_1$, and $R_0=D_0/N_0$.

\bigskip
Crude estimates of comparative parameters

- **incidence proportion difference** $\quad \text{RD} = R_1 - R_0$
- **incidence proportion ratio** $\quad \quad \quad \text{RR} = R_1/R_0$
- **incidence odds ratio** $$\text{OR} = \frac{R_1/(1 - R_1)}{R_0/(1 - R_0)}$$

**NB**. To remove *confounding*, the estimated must be adjusted for relevant *confounders*.


## Example: OS vs. PN (cont'd)

Crude estimates of true risk difference $\theta$, risk ratio $\phi$, and \\ odds ratio $\psi$ between OS and PN:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\RD & = & \frac{77}{350} - \frac{60}{350} = 0.22 - 0.171 = 
        + {\bf 0.049} \ (+ 4.9\%)\\
\RR & = & \frac{77/350}{60/350} = \frac{77/60}{350/350} = \frac{0.22}{0.171} = {\bf 1.283}\\
\OR & = & \frac{77/273}{60/290} = \frac{0.22/(1 - 0.22)}{0.171/(1 - 0.171)} = {\bf 1.363}
\end{eqnarray*}

PN appears more successful than OS.

Is this (a) true, (b) due to bias, or (c) due to chance?

## Example: OS vs. PN (cont'd)

Standard error of log(RR), 95\% error factor (EF) of RR, and 95\% CI for true risk ratio $\phi$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\SEL & = & \sqrt{ \frac{1}{73} + \frac{1}{60} - \frac{1}{350} - \frac{1}{350}}\\
     & = & {\bf 0.1547}\\
     & { } & {  }\\
\EF & = & \text{exp}\{1.96 \times 0.1547\}\\
    & = & {\bf 1.3543}\\
    & { } & {   }\\
\CI & = & [1.2833/1.3543, 1.2833 \times 1.3543]\\
    & = & [{\bf 0.9476}, {\bf 1.7380}].
\end{eqnarray*}


## Estimating comparative parameters in R

- A multitude of R functions in several packages are readily available for point estimation and CI calculation using either ``exact'' or/and various approximative methods.
\medskip
- We shall here demonstrate the use of function `twoby2()` in the `Epi package`.  It applies the simple Wald approximations as described above, but for 
  + risk difference: the Newcombe method is used, and 
  + odds ratio: the `exact` conditional method is also available.
  
- Hence, similar results are expected as obtained above.

## Use of function `twoby2()`

- Loading the `Epi package`:
```{r}
library(Epi)
```
- Reading the counts of the 2 x 2-table into a matrix: 

```{r}
counts <- c(77, 273, 60, 290)
tab <- matrix( counts, nrow=2, byrow=T)
```

- Viewing the contents of the matrix/table: 
```{r,comment=NA}
tab
```
## Make 2 by 2 table
- Calling the function with `tab` as its argument: 

\tiny

```{r, comment=NA}
twoby2(tab)
```

\normalsize

## Analyses based on binary regression model

Crude estimates and CIs for the comparative parameters can also be obtained by fitting appropriate **binary regression models** for the numbers $D_j$ or proportions $R_j$.

Special cases of **generalized linear models** (GLM) with

- (i) **random part**: $D_j$ is assumed to obey the binomial distribution or {\bf family} with index $N_j$ and probability $\pi_j$,
- (ii) **systematic part**: **linear predictor** $\eta_j = \alpha + \beta X_j$, in which $X_j = 0$ for unexposed and $X_j = 1$ for exposed, 
- (iii) **link function**: $g(.)$ that connects the probability $\pi_j$ and the systematic part $\eta_j$ by: $$g(\pi_j) = \eta_j = \alpha + \beta X_j$$
